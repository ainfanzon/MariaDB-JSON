# Manage and control JSON data

Over the last 15 years, JSON has become ubiquitous on the web. Today it is the format of choice for almost every publicly available web service, and it is frequently used for private web services as well. Itâ€™s interesting to think about the fact that the first wave of APIs were based on XML but now it is being discarded as being too heavy and too clunky. These days, JSON is becoming the mainstay of API technology. 
Why would I even want JSON data in my DB?

This blog explains why using the MariaDB Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for storing JSON is a good idea. To do so, some real life examples are used to demonstrate how MariaDB and JSON are used to:

1. Simplify database schema designs.     
2. Make schema evolution more manageable.  
3. Mix the power of MariaDB (SQL joins) with the flexibility of the JSON data.  
4. Reduce JSON management tools heterogeneity.  

Practical examples are presented in this blog. The JSON functions used in this blog are fully documented in the MariaBD JSON functions knowledge base page. for further details
